# Project README

## Overview

This repository contains various components for generating 3D models and working with different AI models and pipelines. The primary focus of the project is to generate 3D models from text prompts, train models, perform image fusion, and evaluate the results. The project includes multiple notebooks, scripts, and directories dedicated to tasks such as text-to-3D model conversion, background removal, model training, and evaluation.

## Directory Structure

Here's an overview of the key files and directories in the project:

### Files

- **`Prompt_Generation.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for generating prompts used in text-to-image generation.

- **`SDXL_to_BG_removal.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook that utilizes the SDXL model for image generation and background removal.
- **`main_pipeline.py`**: Main script that executes the entire pipeline, from generation to evaluation.

- **`z123dataloader.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for loading data related to the `zero123++` model.

### Directories

- **`SDXL`**: Contains files related to the SDXL background removal model and image generation from text prompts.

- **`Text_to_3D_Eval_Models`**: Contains models and code for evaluating text-to-3D conversion.

- **`UX`**: Contains user interface code for interacting with the models and pipelines.

- **`evaluation`**: Directory dedicated to evaluating models and processing evaluation metrics.

- **`experiments`**: Contains experimental setups, test cases, and model configurations.

- **`imageTo3D`**: Contains code and models related to converting images into 3D models.

- **`image_fusion`**: Directory for experiments and code related to image fusion.

- **`model_training`**: Contains code for training various models related to text-to-image and 3D model generation.

- **`zero123++`**: Directory for the `zero123++` model, likely related to zero-shot learning or image generation tasks.

## Features

- **Text-to-3D Conversion**: Generate 3D models from textual descriptions.

- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate models for generating and processing 3D content.

- **Image Fusion**: Fuse multiple images into a single representation for advanced image generation.

- **Evaluation**: Evaluate and test models using pre-configured metrics and experiments.
